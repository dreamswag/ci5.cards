**ci5.cards | Behavioral Infiltration Engine**

**A Whitepaper Overview of Distributed Identity Stability & Telemetry Poisoning**

## **1\. Abstract**

Within the CI5 ecosystem, **ci5.cards** represents the transition from passive protection to active adversarial engagement. While ci5.core and ci5.run ensure the integrity of the hardware and network stack, .cards weaponizes the resulting stability. By utilizing a **Proof-of-Stamina (PoS)** consensus, the system generates high-fidelity "Ghost Identities" that pollute global telemetry margins. This document outlines the technical architecture of the LARPification protocol and the ASH-HEX reputation economy.

**2\. The Problem: The "Data Hole" Signature**

Traditional privacy tools (VPNs, TOR, ad-blockers) create a conspicuous lack of data. Modern AI-driven surveillance identifies these "data holes" as high-probability indicators of technical users or automated bots.

* **The Counter:** To remain truly invisible, a node must not simply block trackers; it must **occupy** the tracker's database with a logically consistent, boring, and high-trust fiction.

**3\. The Solution: LARPification & Ghost Tanks**

ci5.cards introduces the **Identity Idle-Sim**. It operates on the principle that **Consistency \= Trust**.

### **3.1 Docker "Ghost Tank" Isolation**

Each card executes within a strictly sandboxed Docker environment.

* **Hardware Masking:** Uses LLVMpipe for software-based CPU rendering, stripping the unique GPU/Canvas fingerprints of the Broadcom VideoCore VII.  
* **Proc-Emulation:** Containers are fed a virtualized /proc/uptime and CPU flag set, ensuring the tracker cannot "fingerprint" the host Pi 5 hardware.  
* **MACVLAN Routing:** Each Ghost is assigned a unique, non-virtual MAC address, appearing to the local network and VPN gateway as a distinct physical device.

### **3.2 The Integration LARP Protocol**

To avoid "Pattern Break" detection, the system executes a 14-day transition period known as the **Drift**.

* **Phase 1 (Incubation):** 90% legacy traffic, 10% new persona "curiosity" pings.  
* **Phase 2 (Migration):** Jittering of metadata (fonts, screen resolutions) to simulate a "new device" purchase.  
* **Phase 3 (Dominance):** Full transition to the new behavioral archetype.

**4\. The ASH-HEX Economy: Proof-of-Stamina**

The ecosystem is secured by the **Stamina Milestone**—a metric of continuous hardware and network stability.

### **4.1 Redemption & Redlining**

Uptime is verified locally and hashed against the hardware ID (HWID).

* **Milestones:** Reaching 30, 90, and 200 days of uptime awards **ASH-HEX**.  
* **Utility:** ASH-HEX is redeemed for "Advanced Testing Scopes" (Elite Cards). These cards contain more complex, higher-value poisoning schemas that require high-reputation nodes to bypass advanced bot filters.

### **4.2 The "Slack" (Stability Grace Period)**

To prevent unfair resets due to standard power flickers, a tiered grace period is applied:

* **Bronze (0-30d):** 30-minute recovery window.  
* Obsidian (200d+): 12-hour recovery window.  
  This ensures that "Veterans" are not punished for real-world infrastructure failures while maintaining the integrity of the long-term behavioral data.

**5\. Peer Review: The OverWatch Judicial Layer**

To protect the community from malicious "Dogwhistle" submissions (state-sponsored beaconing), .cards serves a local **OverWatch** dashboard.

### **5.1 The Hashed Mixing Pool (Secret Santa)**

User-submitted traits (interests, URLs, timing) are broken into **Atomic Trait Packets**.

1. **Blind Pull:** New users pull 10+ random packets from different Veterans to form a persona.  
2. **Dilution:** This makes it mathematically impossible for an adversary to identify a user via a single "dogwhistle" trait, as that trait is scattered across thousands of nodes.

### **5.2 The CS:GO Cooldown Model**

Veterans review incoming traits via the local UI.

* **Honeypots:** The system inserts "Known-Bad" traits to test investigator accuracy.  
* **Silent Slashing:** Bad actors aren't banned; they are partitioned into a **Shadow Lobby** where their submissions only affect other bad actors, rendering their efforts inert.

**6\. Strategic Milestones**

| Nodes | Tactical Level | Economic Consequence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **10,000** | Signal Loss | Regional ad-spend ROI drops by \~12% due to "Ghost Leads." |
| **100,000** | Model Hallucination | Behavioral AI models begin training on CI5-generated "Ground Truth." |
| **1,000,000** | **Market Collapse** | Tracking costs exceed data value. Industry forced back to contextual advertising. |

**7\. Conclusion**

ci5.cards turns the act of maintaining a stable home server into a revolutionary act. By rewarding **Hardware Stamina** with **Identity Armor**, the network creates an unbreakable loop: the more stable your node is, the more damage you do to the systems that seek to track you.
