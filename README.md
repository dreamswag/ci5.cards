# 🃏 ci5.cards: The Telemetry Dealer 🃏

### Welcome to the Table! 

- **ci5.cards** is the official Sovereign Dealer for the Ci5 ecosystem. 
- This isn't a firewall; it's a **High-Stakes Game**: 
  - where the telemetry services are the Blinds
  - and you hold the Jokers 🃏

Most leave the table (**blocking**); We stay for the **Showdown**. 

## 🃏 The Game: "The Joker Serves You" 🃏

S2026 Meta indicates that staying silent is a losing hand:

- The House (Big Tech) already knows your seat number. 
- **ci5.cards** just enables you to finally play with them. 

Whenever a service asks for your data, the Dealer pulls a card from your deck:

- a perfectly plausible, cryptographically elegant identity card 🃏
